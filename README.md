Let's Share Some Awesome EditPad Stuff!
==

The title says it all: the purpose of this repo is to share cool stuff we've made for EPP, and to improve some of those tools collaboratively. Some of the themes this repo aims to cover: 

 - [color palettes](/Making%20Text%20Pretty%20-%20Syntax%20Coloring%20and%20Color%20Palettes/Color%20Palettes) (which can be applied to various languages)
 - [syntax coloring schemes](/Making%20Text%20Pretty%20-%20Syntax%20Coloring%20and%20Color%20Palettes/Syntax%20Coloring%20Schemes) for specific languages / file types
 - An [AutoHotkey Starting Kit for EditPad](https://github.com/boolbag/EditPad-Goodies/tree/master/AutoHotkey%20Starter%20Kit%20for%20EPP)
 - file navigation for specific languages / file types
 - useful scripts or binaries that can be called via EPP macros
 - [inspiring screenshots](Screenshots%20for%20Inspiration%20-%20Toolbars%2C%20Layouts) of EPP layouts and toolbars
 - links to other repos or resources related to EditPad
 - more!

## Two Ways to Participate

There are two ways to participate: the super-easy way for those who don't use `git`, and the "git way" for those who would like to collaborate actively on certain features.

The more the merrier. 

It would be fantastic to have a number of collaborators, each in charge of their own directories within the repo.


### (i) The Super-Easy Way: Send a Message

Have a comment about a typo or coloring scheme but don't feel like diving into the internals?

* Click the __Issues__ button at the top of the page then the green button that says _New Issue_, or directly click this [New Issue Link](/issues/new). 
* Try to be as specific as possible, and please attach screenshots when it makes sense.


### (ii) Become a Collaborator on this Repo 

* If you'd like to work on an **existing feature**, please clone and send a pull request.
* If you'd like to work on a **new feature**, such as a new syntax-coloring schemes, or even just upload your own screenshots, I'll add you as a _Collaborator_. In theory that gives you complete Push access, but we'll agree that you'll just manage your own directories within the existing arborescence. To set that up, please contact me via the EPP forum so that I know you're a real EPP user (do a search for a thread mentioning EditPad-Goodies started by Rex and I'll receive your message).
