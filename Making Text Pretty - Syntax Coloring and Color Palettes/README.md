IMPORTANT: What You Need To Understand About Coloring Code in EditPad Pro 7
===========================================================================

Before starting to change the colors of your Python scheme in EPP7, there are a couple of things that you **must** know, otherwise you'll be wasting a lot of effort and getting very frustrated.

1. Coloring is controlled on a file-type basis: _.txt_ files, _.ini_ files and _.python_ files have their own settings. 

2. For each file type, coloring is controlled via the _Options / Configure File Types / Colors and Syntax Tab_ menus.

3. For each file type, you must select two things:

   * A **color palette**. This is basically just a collection of colors meant to work together. A color palette can be applied to any file type, but will only work well if that file type has a _syntax-coloring scheme_ that uses that palette.

   * A **syntax-coloring scheme**. This is basically a "grammar file" that tells EPP how to understand the file: for instance, which words in a programming language are keywords related to flow control, and so on. For each element, 

4. Usually, a syntax-coloring scheme is optimized to display well with a specific color palette. In other words, **there is no point installing, say, the [_Markdown for MishMash_](https://github.com/boolbag/EditPad-Goodies/tree/master/Making%20Text%20Pretty%20-%20Syntax%20Coloring%20and%20Color%20Palettes/Syntax%20Coloring%20Schemes/Markdown/Markdown%20for%20MishMash) coloring scheme unless you first install the [_MishMash_ color palette](https://github.com/boolbag/EditPad-Goodies/tree/master/Making%20Text%20Pretty%20-%20Syntax%20Coloring%20and%20Color%20Palettes/Color%20Palettes/MishMash).**

5. As of EPP 7, installing color palettes takes a bit more than a button click: it's a manual job that requires about five minutes of your full attention. More about this in the [Color Palettes section](./Color%20Palettes).


# And nowâ€¦ Have fun! 

In this section there are awesome options to color your code, and you are invited to contribute more. 

The first thing you should probably do is install the [_MishMash_ color palette](https://github.com/boolbag/EditPad-Goodies/tree/master/Making%20Text%20Pretty%20-%20Syntax%20Coloring%20and%20Color%20Palettes/Color%20Palettes/MishMash).
