# AutoHotkey & EditPad Pro: the State of Things

Frankly, for AutoHotkey in EditPad, things are excellent. For large projects spanning many files and thousands of lines of code, I haven't found a better set-up to edit AutoHotkey programs than EditPad Pro. Of course that's just my taste.


#### Syntax-Coloring

I'm aware of two syntax-coloring schemes for AutoHotkey in EditPad:

1. [AutoHotkey for MishMash](https://github.com/boolbag/Autohotkey-Goodies/tree/master/Syntax%20Coloring%20Scheme%20for%20EditPad%20Pro), which I wrote from scratch in April 2019. It's made specifically to work with my [MishMash color palette](/Making%20Text%20Pretty%20-%20Syntax%20Coloring%20and%20Color%20Palettes/Color%20Palettes/MishMash).

2. Tim's scheme from 2012, which also acknowledges Jay Hegener (sorry @Tim, the scheme doesn't give your website, otherwise I would have linked to you.)  I believe this will work better with a standard light scheme.  

The two are different beasts as the parsers were written independently and divide the language into different token groups.


#### File Navigation

I'm only aware of one scheme, _AHK AutoHotkey_ by [Klaus Daube](http://www.daube.ch). I haven't had a single complaint with it, so I haven't modified it.
