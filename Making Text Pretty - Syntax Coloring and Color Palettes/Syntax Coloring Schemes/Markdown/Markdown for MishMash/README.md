# TL;DR This scheme was made specifically for the MishMash color palette

1. If you don't have EditPad **[click here for a free trial](http://yu8.us/eppdemo)**

2. If you want this scheme to look good, first install the [MishMash color palette](/Making%20Text%20Pretty%20-%20Syntax%20Coloring%20and%20Color%20Palettes/Color%20Palettes/MishMash) into EditPad.

## Here are six screenshots that also explain the scheme and the basics of Markdown

Just so you know, I may have changed the scheme slightly since making the screenshots.
