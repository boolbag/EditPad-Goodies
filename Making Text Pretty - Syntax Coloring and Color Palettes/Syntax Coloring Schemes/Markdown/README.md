# Markdown & EditPad Pro: the state of things

![Markdown for MishMash](https://github.com/boolbag/EditPad-Goodies/blob/master/Making%20Text%20Pretty%20-%20Syntax%20Coloring%20and%20Color%20Palettes/Syntax%20Coloring%20Schemes/Markdown/Markdown%20for%20MishMash/screenshots/demo.jpg)

Frankly, things are pretty good. For Markdown in EditPad, I'm aware of two syntax-coloring schemes.

1. [Markdown for MishMash](Markdown%20for%20MishMash), which I wrote from scratch on a grey Sunday of April 2019. It's made specifically to work with my [MishMash color palette](/Making%20Text%20Pretty%20-%20Syntax%20Coloring%20and%20Color%20Palettes/Color%20Palettes/MishMash) and contains a bit of syntax just for GitHub.

2. The original whose idea of marking up Markdown inspired me and which I used for a while, [EditPad-Pro-Markdown](https://github.com/marek-stoj/EditPad-Pro-Markdown) by marek-stoj, also on GitHub.

Both have their strengths. Marek seems to handle things like `html` code blocks, which mine doesn't at the moment. (I just never need that feature, but if I did, I would embed the _html_ within a code block.)

The choice in yours! But you don't even have to choose, you can install both.
